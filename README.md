## Description

Building a CMS-style blog site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well.  This will be deployed on Heroku and will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and express-session npm package for authentication.
